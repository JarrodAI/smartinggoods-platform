Before we dive in, tell me a bit about your business:
- How long have you been in business?
- What's your biggest challenge right now?
- What are your goals for the next 6-12 months?"
```

**2. Pain Point Discovery (10 minutes)**

Ask these key questions:
- "How do you currently handle customer bookings?"
- "How much time do you spend on marketing each week?"
- "Do you have a system for following up with customers?"

```

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:

```

**Closing Questions:**
- "Does this make sense for your business?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Are you ready to get started?"

**Handle Objections:**

*"It's too expensive"*
```
"I understand. Let's look at it this way - if this brings you just 
5 extra customers per month at $100 each, that's $500. You're 
investing $1,950 to make $5,000+. That's a 2.5x return."
```

*"I need to think about it"*
```
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns 
do you have? Let's address those now so you have all the information 
you need."
```
